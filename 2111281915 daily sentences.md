#### problem statement for a productivity patterns database. 

* There is a gap in existing frameworks on the selection of an appropriate productivity system for personal or small business knowledge management. The fronts that direct thinking as of today are the broader #toolsofthought collectives around note-taking applications and productivity coaching shops of note-taking, journaling, and writing. Both advice selective positions that may not be appropriate or can hinder productivity if badly implemented. For eg. all note-taking frameworks are for text based notes. When it comes to visual note-taking the ones available are incompatible or grossly inadequate. This leaves a fissure between drawing, writing, and analysing. There is no way to measure good or bad PKMs but an alternative should exist where those interested have a range of systems to pick from. Productivity theories or systems act as templates that are a set of patterns. Instead of implementing a template, encourage design, building and implementation of hybrid PKM's and PIM's. Either to get things done or to create knowledge. Every system or theory is on a page with its description and its various patterns listed. Resources around each framework will also be compiled in time. For the very first stage is to simply make a list of what the available sets are around. After getting some funds go about distilling, isolating patterns from the framework lists. It is an open research initiative. Can it be collective social exercise, that for the moment I do have my doubts.<br>
