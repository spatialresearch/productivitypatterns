* Today is a hack.
An ideating day.
The lot is an information set collecting three sets of thought.
On what is design methods as an ideology.
Design methods sounds like research methods but is not the same is what I understand as of now.
Research methods analyses literature and data while design methods addresses only operational protocols.
There is no research in design methods and there is a lot more of intuition.
For e.g. a style like deconstruction or minimalism is a design methodology derived from a post-modernist frame of thought.
Kind of.
To design a building of a style you follow prescribed methods sourced about that particular style.
These methods are then applied to generate an output in the desired aesthetic.
How to think about what methods are around for now is a project that needs looking into.
This list is a compilation of possible methods.
Some of these can have sub-types.
Others almost linked to each other.
Many of them are used in combination most often.
To better understand, how often is design methods used in or with reference to what in architecture is a requirement.
Of sorts.
A hypothesis to consider is Alexander was the only architect of a time that parleyed with designers or anyone in the design science community.
For architecture to be part of that conversation is a result of that association.
With Eisenman et al. #architecture becomes what we have, in its current form of discourse.

  * Mr. Nam-joon Baek once said that by the 21st century of his life, all the factories and workplaces of the world will be filled by robots and AI, so people will live a positive outlook on the future imagining how to enjoy the remaining boring time. If art and humour are missing, how can modern people endure the long, boring daily life. It is perhaps natural for writers to be fascinated by intangible images and material objects to escape the sea of work creation. Imagine that. If all mankind became artists, it would be a bit poetic with artistic incidents every day, but how good it would be for world peace and for limited earth resources. https://www.facebook.com/noam.gim/posts/10220282246558460 
  * There will be busy art and free art just like there are busy daily lives and free daily lives. Art is good to meet sometimes in busy life. If you are always wearing a job badge, you don't know it's precious, you become uncomfortable or unhappy. Art should be an object of observation and an object of longing. https://www.facebook.com/noam.gim/posts/10220264103784902
