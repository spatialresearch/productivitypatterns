* building data of architecture, memory and new imaginations
### Context.
* We are in a post information age, and especially after the last two years, there's a visible increase in material that is accessible on any subject and in any form. 
Architects, designers, and spatial consultants are trained to solve problems visually and predominantly as drawings or diagrams. 
Information collected are often times visuals, images that are then processed into knowledge products.
What a knowledge product is especially for architects is not always clear from a position we work from.
How do we produce knowledge?
Who consumes our work?
What is research for us?
Depending on who participates in the inquiry what is knowledge or for that matter new knowledge created by a practice.
Traditionally we were or are still dependent on creating new visual styles that extend what we understand as domain knowledge.
Research comes with specific methodologies and prerequisites that only those interested will delve into.
Instead of seeing the domain only through the lens of drawing, what are the other alternatives possible?
What possibilities, ways to think about spatial problem solving could present itself if data in any format rather than the traditional material we are used to working with is refactored.
### Questions.
* How can we explore digital archives to think new imaginaries and develop new narratives about and by buildings? To make a drawing we first gather material from various sources, distil them into the limits set by the question we are trying to answer. Can there be new narratives if the ways of making remain the same. To create something newer than before, recipes of making should change. How it changes that is the problem at hand to address. What are the newer methodologies to tell new stories with all the new material we have access to.   
* In which visual and written languages are the new narratives and imaginaries created, and how are they organised? Direction of any visual trends is very subject to the patronage, that a medium received or has the tentative potential to garner support. Any new innovation ideally is built on some idea that is already successful and by extended association have the necessary resources to try out new directions.
* Are there other kinds of narrative systems, non-visual, non-linguistic? Material and sensory ones? And what would that mean? Bodies of work by architectural practice is a narrative of spatial practices that has developed over a period its spent in practice and the various associations that have resulted in a kind of work produced by it. There is the #alexander archive which can develop or then there is the archive generated out of reading of an annual review of architectural though about practice. Whatever that might be.
* Who is developing the narratives, and for whom? This raises the very important question why is any more information or ideas on architecture, urbanism, and spatial planning really important. All significant work is already done, will this new material make any sense. What is the role of work produced by private architectural practices in the form of research make an impact especially in the new information landscape? There is formal research in urban planning but architecture and urban design is very confusing of the present state it is in.  
* If post-humanism might (re-)direct the new data-landscapes, what sort of data buildings might come out of this shift? Before we get to post human, what conditions and data types are present in thinking about these shifts in information generation. Who is producing what kind of data and in what form do we have access to it. Design methods is a frame of thinking about formal production which is adequately not explored. To change design making, the method design is imagined in needs re-imagination. What is the data that a method generated? If another is used what kind of information does this material makes into knowledge. 
* And, how do data collections change architectural research and practice regarding the past, present, and future? You have drones, satellite imagery, virtual reality and game environments present newer perspectives of reading the built environment. Without addressing how these perspectives are changing rules to engage with building and spatial cultures may not get very far. Or methods of studying and analysing history also is from a dated technological position which needs questioning and why we see the past, present and the future the way we are seeing it today? Will that change when seen through the lens of technology and augmented reality?  
* Where is the building in this vast, interactive and extractive information system of data production? To answer that it is pertinent to inquire how spatial activity and cultures produce data about it. The position is similar to points raised previously on mediums, technology and the data-sets they produce. Even sun path, urban heat modelling or spatial analysis tools all of them gather data which needs specific methodology to analyse and apply in design. What is the data and information we collected to design then and how do we collect the same information today? If there are differences does that reflect in any way the design solutions we produce?
