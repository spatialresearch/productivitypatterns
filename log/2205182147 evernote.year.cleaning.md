* cleaning out evernote.
* Just sorting out notes can take a whole day.
Notes now operate at three scales.
These daily sentences, snippets captured either on evernote or onenote, then several other documents that make up image and document libraries.
Notes are records of information accessed.
It can be anything and in any form.
Either you take them on your own, copy parts of it, or archive the whole thing.
Too many tools have now distributed where notes can actually locate itself in.
Pointing out from yesterday, ideally all these daily notes are posted online but they for now remain very much local directory based.
Evernote last year was in a mess.
With updates every month things are looking interesting especially when it deals with attachments.
To be able to post images directly into a note is not very efficient anywhere else.
For a visual workflow evernote works.
I have reviewed only from the December of 2021 for this.
So that is six months.
To adequately review notes, instead of monthly reviews, weekly reviews is also very necessary.
Then combine all the four reviews into one monthly one. 
The rest of the month is ideally a sum of reviews of just notes and information traces.
A main concern dealing with notes are if the tagging is efficient.
Evernote had problems with sorting notes on its interface, it didn't group notes as alphabets. 
This update questions if its necessary to log the timestap on notes but just leave it as text titles. 
Note types seem more important to address than when the note was take.
It would be worthwhile to list the number of applications I looked into, in addition to the zoom lectures I attended.
Ideas worked on and progress of writing during the span of this review.
