## 2205261011 book.list.framework

* big move day, planning five e-books together.
* Conceptualised yesterday and implemented today, this file/ folder sorting is the largest reorganisation done since machimach.
This is spatialresearchdotnet's first significant restructuring.
Daily sentences now is almost locked into system where something is logged every-day.
How do you think with sentences everyday that it can at the end of year become an e-book?
Book08 #bigcityarchive.
Book09 #culturalprecincts.
Book10 #writingpractice.
Book11 #indianarchitecture.
There are now only two big working folders which are obsidian vaults.
The other two are potential future books on urbanism and architecture, book 13 and 14.
It is an #alexanderkoolhaas moment of thinking.
Book12 #alexanderkoolhaas.
More than notes what obsidian and foam has facilitated is thinking about files and folders via a graph.
The graph is almost like excel but all the systems that note-taking has introduced results in an anxiety to write more.
Trick now is to draw more in the process and convert it to sync with writing.
It is not data visualisation but a meditation of form that writing can generate.
If texts could be images how will it look like.
Everything now starts with foam, then proceeds to obsidian.
Evernote is a parallel activity.
Writing drafts is a very OneNote pursuit, its limit is only the lack of word count.
Foam + Obsidian vs Evernote + OneNote, all of this published on Notion.
Everything comes into Evernote, processed in foam and obsidian, sorted out in OneNote and finally processed in Word.
The notes here are for idea management. 
Not for learning or information management.
Every year as planned becomes a book.
Both writing and drawing should happen daily, for now writing is almost there.
Every day is published somewhere, priority Substack, then Medium, #alexanderkoolhaas Instagram, and this that on Facebook.
Images for now will come in after a set of daily sentences are processed of earlier texts into md files.
