* the living archive, from a past for a future.
* We are inundated with data and information sets of all forms and stature.
Unlike five years back the material access we have to make new-knowledge about on built environment have exponentially increased than how architects are traditionally trained. 
Augmented automation and increased dependence on software applications have limited our imagination on strategies for intervention which is now only made possible by how much access we have on the latest in tech.
To limit architectural innovation to advancements of technology is a cause of concern.
If there is an architect who's work connect both tech and building practice it is Christopher Alexander.
Several software engineers credit his work as foundation to their thinking of how they compile, connect their code.
Alexander is largely forgotten in architecture and very few know anything about him other than two of his books.
Though people complained about his formulas in the Notes of Synthesis of Form, today we have Rhino scripts that automate similar formal aspirations he worked out manually.
The paper, attempts a discussion on an ongoing pursuit of modeling an open access archive on a body of an architectural practice, with material sourced from different sources from around the internet.
A library is made up of books, or other extended object collections but an archive is tricky and not always easy to navigate.
For a practice to lend its organized hard-drives as a living archive is one what are the resources does it take to assemble one about a practice?  
A rough outline of extents of Alexander's work is found in his cv and three of his websites. 
The architectural archive is also very contextual as an instrument which makes engagement with it possible to those who have access to it within the limits of domains i.e. artists, and researchers.
To make a digital archive is to first model the kind of work Alexander produced and the derivative work which was and still being produced.
It also makes possible a multidisciplinary virtual space to bring multiple stakeholders together is a discussion on possible futures of ideas of spatial patterning at the various scales Alexander and his colleagues worked on in their practice. 
Rather than introduce all the problems with data, a clear explanation of archive making would suffice.

  * We live at the worst of times. Yet we live at the best of times. For we are free, on this large Island, as yesterdays events in Westminster echo, to live according to rules that we make up ourselves with no reference to any one else. Yet we also know as British Architects, that this large island was ever far, far away from the five autonomous birthplaces of the high Architectural Cultures of China, India, Mesopotamia, Egypt and Mesoamerica. We know also that the overseas Lodestars of Modernism have lost their navigational persuasions. https://www.facebook.com/john.outram.71/posts/5175541555858854
