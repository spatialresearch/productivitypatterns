* meta takes conversations.
* A point of concern with ideas these days is they get outdated quite easily.
Times change and changes bring newness with it.
Ideas that seem new can get outdated when someone else turns up with a newer and better implementation of it.
Sentences, extends into reports of a month, which collected is conversations about the year.
Meta is doing just that as updates.
Architectural theory has or should change its form.
With conversation the attempt is to create a living archive, to keep having a discussion on the making of architecture and what are the trends that impact changes in the making of architecture.
#roamresearch presented a proposition to assemble all notes within a singular proprietary infrastructure.
This is a problem, all work is done only as text.
Reading, writing, and drawing has very different workflows how to integrate all of that is the problem addressed here.
The Meta position with conversation is updates on its messaging services, with annual conversations it is a platform to create a discussion on the subject of an year which has gone by or of a past.
Conversation solicits a discourse on spatial practices and what are the significant events to factor for the future.
The past is an inspiration, past as theory of any form makes a future.
All architecture practice is about creating a theory, a theory from a culture of making.
What is the possible theory note-taking can create is a question to address.
A library of documents is a tool for thought.
It needs structure of some type for retrieval.
Then there is the notes, why is it taken and what role does it play for a future?
Right now the notes are an attempt to create conversations around the various content snippets.
How do you bridge the gap between sentences and sentences that become essays that are a part of conversations is another bridge to address as well.
Daily sentences take time, a lot of it sometimes.
That spills into cleaning of past notes while creating new notes daily that needs to get uploaded.
One of the main problems in a past was how many ideas made up an essay?
How is a text compiled as a string of ideas that has some coherent links with each other.
This idea extends into making of a personal graph as a grand narrative.
Graphs are ideally linked blocks, at-least in principle.
I though am linking files instead of ideas together.
Linked files make more sense than linked ideas in blocks. 
All of this impacts the making of sentences and therefore the extended conversations that they become at the end of the year.
Conversations from Meta is about their messaging services.
Books by architects were also instruments of discussions with fellow architects and potential client on what an architectural practice could offer as solutions while contributing to the larger domain discourse.
