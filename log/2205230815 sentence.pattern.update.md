## 2205230815 sentence.pattern.update

* updates to the daily sentences template.
* It is now one year and three months taking notes, as daily notes.
#roamresearch daily notes page started the project but published daily sentences are now in the 11th month running.
There are uses to do these notes daily but they also take up quite a bit of time.
The above to point out is a running complaint and I for now am not very sure if these sentences have to continue or should close.
For sake of record daily sentences in word was considered fleeting in the early stages.
Line numbers and grid stages limits to the problem.
Fleeting sentences were to represent daily thought jogs but now they since they are planning notes, it needs a system to retrieve them and get that project in place.
For all its proposed convinces management of links and tags have replaced working with folders.
Since there are no folders in a graph-linked knowledge world, knowing what links you create is a newer problem of the times.
From working these sentences in word, now vs code and foam is the new site for sentences making.
Obsidian is there to see how the map of links are becoming.
Information deluge has reached a point where management of personal information is a project by itself.
This poses the question what is an architectural project and how is it answered?
When in the past one reference book would suffice, but today with multiple cross-references rather than provide answers, information sets can end up confusing the task at hand.
Daily sentences are ideally a framework to organise project information but to get there needs work.
#roamcult creates an anxiety where it didn't exist, an anxiety of material getting lost.
Sorting through collected information sets has made possible a new ways of giving form to a research project.
