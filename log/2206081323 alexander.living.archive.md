* christopher alexander, modeling a living archive
* We avoided having to do much with ideas by Alexander since at a time it wasn't grandiose enough.
Even though he leaves behind an extensive body of work, it is discussed mostly by other domains such as computer scientists and mathematicians.
Alexander's death was mourned more on the hacker news website than any significant architectural publication.
His influence is clearly multidisciplinary.
We forget Alexander after a 1982 discussion he and Eisenman has at Harvard.
Deconstruction and everything else the revolution of '68 brings along with it we chose over what Alexander has to offer. 
What we have today is very defendant on our relationship to software.
It is only through the perspectives that digital tools gives us, we imagine architecture, spatial practices today.
Software, proverbially has truly eaten our world, more so that we give it credit. 
Given the fact developers, software engineers are still consuming Alexander and writing code inspired by his work, it seems essential to develop and contemporary discourse on architecture, it needs a reading from a body of work produced between 1963 and 2012.
Architectural practices to better solve design problems of the day should ideally work at the intersection between art and computation, a space still very nascent.
Can a better understanding of work by Alexander direct an alternate direction for architectural discourse, an update perhaps?
A physical archive of the practice is definitely present and accessible but is it possible to assemble a structured, chronological archive of his work from the several sources it is distributed online?
Even if present owing to its scattered state it is today, how can it be re-compiled and situated under a singular broader frame?
What are the resources required to find material to rebuild a body of work and make it available either publicly?
