* everyone should get themselves a living archive.
* In the post-information age, there is way more data, information sets and knowledge products than we need and can use.
The question squarely is how can all this material be put to use more audaciously while in process informing an architectural practice?
Making of the architectural archive is subject to legacy which is at often times decided by institutional curatorial mandates.
Even though spatial solutions is what the architectural practice is recognised for, all are practices are eventually building living archives of work.
If the end of all pursuits of a practice is the archive, why is not the ultimate design the practice leaves behind as a grand narrative of contribution to a discourse of a domain be the first design intervention.
The archive as a manifesto on a practice that could have been or that in some capacity is in progress.
If a practice has to start with the archive what are the ways to address it?
Learning of architecture starts with an apprentice with a master, someone or a culture who has contributed to rethinking of architecture as a domain.
A newer perspective to see the profession and add to its repository of solutions to inspire work.
The archive as method of thinking about what direction a practice can take instead of a directed method that later becomes an archive.
An archive is not a library.
An archive is a set of records of a past, while the library is a collection of a specific set of objects.
The archive is more self organizing than a library which can have a lot more things.
It is also source for other ways to thinking about making of spatial solutions.
What are the ways found records of past architectural practices can make or imagine a new one?
AI is too soon for architecture, lets wait a bit here.
