* abstract:: finding personal productivity patterns through a brief history of note-taking
* An urgency to create notes and therefore a system to create intelligence from it is very influenced by the #roamcult. 
Without RoamResearch as ideology we wouldn't have this discussion.
The proposition they and now every other .mdish note-taking app outlined is, the amount of information today's knowledge worker has access to is much higher than what was previously considered even possible.
Their thesis is to make sense of it all you should take notes and link those notes together within an ecosystem their apps create.
The process of taking notes creates more information of information which doesn't solve the problem of material excess but only patches it, also while possibly complicating the problem.
If there is a date when I formally entered this discourse it is on the 23rd of February 2021, when I signed into #roamresearch and began #roamlearning. 
To do Roam takes up a lot of your time in learning how to take notes in the application by being part of the community and its extended activities. 
The template Conor et al. creates, 1. theory, 2. system, and 3. community is now taken as model for thinking knowledge management for a part of the internet.
This discussion is about situations leading to a theory on PKM, alternatively how is a theory about a personal knowledge management assembled?
Knowledge graphs are an industrial solution to a problem and up until Roam was used by Google and the likes.
It is never applied previously as a personal solution.
I have begun and traced this exercise several times, so this text will tie all my attempts in thinking about my various note-taking attempts from 1996 till now.
What are my patterns of productivity leading to an imagination of a personal knowledge graph?
