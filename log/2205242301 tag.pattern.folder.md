* trying to tag all sentences.
* I like the interface on vs code, and writing here that is why the sentences are getting made here everyday.
Doing sentences just because it is a like able activity isn't sustainable it needs clarity and articulation into a direction.
The trick is to create a discipline on writing and publishing.
Writing has happened, publishing is now quite delayed.
The sentences as systems is still not formed to generate results.
Organising notes are as good as organising files.
A specific problem is how notes grow old.
When a template like this position now needs updating, all the previous notes needs also updating to work within a new framework of thinking.
It is also a lot more work but it is sold as an essential to attain some anticipatory strata of productivity.
Writing continuously and methodologically can improve a craft, but so can drawing daily or anything daily.
The project also becomes on how to convert all of work produced as a drawing too.
It is a distinct model of thinking about material consumption and the ends of that consumption.
Is writing everyday consumption or production of knowledge?
Time for review and what it takes away from project making is another construct to consider.
What is the form of a project when it is an incrementally generated set of notes?
When hypertext notebooks are becoming a norm can this newer discipline make research writing easier?
Working with folders there are no set mandates to address.
Files are not constantly being tracked.
Here to process and reprocess notes are worth the extra work if some tangible results are derived but after 15months, ideas are still messy or even more messier than when sentences began on the 1st of July 2021.
