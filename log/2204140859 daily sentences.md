* two ways of reading and ordering alexander, possibly a third draft 02
* This wouldn't be possible even five years back, but as of now we are truly in the post-information age.
There is too much to read on any subject and #alexander's patterns is one such example.
When I put together the first draft of this list, #patternlanguage was limited to four books.
Timeless Way, Pattern Language, The Oregon Experiment, and Notes on Synthesis of Form.
It was a world view shown on the second page of the first three books on the limits of a thesis on spatial patterns.
I wasn't going to look beyond the four till Prof. Vasavada pointed me towards the Nature of Order. 
Finding the carpet collection book A Foreshadowing of 21st Century Art and Grabow's Christopher Alexander instilled an urgency to trace and map the landscape created by #patternlanguage.
The two main points that guides the search are the lists on Book 4 of the Nature of Order, The Luminous Ground and Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth.
#patternlanguage as a grand proposition to address status of man and his relationship to the environment as a 13 volume read is a perspective seen from the Nature of Order series.
Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth presents a chronology reading.
Both the lists break down the lot into sections that I have reconfigured here.
For now I have identified four pivotal moments which is hypothesised as shifts the work has gone through.
The final fifth is work done by his collaborators to extend, update the Alexander propositions.
This lot has 25 files comprising of 21 books, 3 reports, and 1 lecture.
16 books are by Alexander, while the rest 5 are directly related reading by other authors.
3 reports and a lecture are incidental finds. 
Everyone knows about the Alexander books, the whole set not many may have looked into them. 
#alexander's published papers is now the new frontier.
