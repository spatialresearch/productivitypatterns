* incremental updates on world seeing. 
* When a perspective shifts, the world seems different even though it is the same. A method "is a particular procedure for accomplishing or approaching something", especially a systematic or established one. The design here is read as architectural design or spatial problem-solving methodologies. Learning in spatial design is predominantly copying patterns and reorganizing them. Does it have a methodology, is anyone's guess. "Christopher Alexander has said, 'If you call it, "It's a Good Idea To Do", I like it very much; if you call it a "Method", I like it but I'm beginning to get turned off; if you call it a "Methodology", I just don't want to talk about it", not a very optimistic position. Design Methodology is an attempt to make design more like science, and resist the urge to veer to the whimsical. Since its adoption has had hindrances as a broad frame, its operation is more a study among the interested. To think in and about methods is not a professional requirement, designers after all are not scientists. The '60s and 70's American and British discourse aren't applied in #contemporary #indianarchitecture since the #indiancontemporarymasters drew their inspiration from master architectural practices whose ideas predate the movement. Publishing anxieties of the eighties drive the imagination of critical regionalism in #india. Design method is a dated term and used in reference to non-spatial and object-oriented problems. After Eisenman, mostly American theory, architecture builds on its style centric discourse. Fast track to now, Rhino scripts is the closest it's reached to #alexander's notes in the synthesis of form, to solicit a re-reading of ideas that were discarded in a past. In this context #indianarchitecture is a field of study about building practices from a region after 1947. Under this gamete what opportunities of seeing the study presents today of the world and various resulting methodologies of note.
