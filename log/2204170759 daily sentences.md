* the alexander research proposal draft 04
### 1.	Title/ #alexandermethods, 1962 - 2012

### 2.	Introduction
* context/ Architectural research as a concept is confused conceptually. This project is part of broader 60year survey to outline its origins and evolutions in relation to architectural history, theory and criticism. The proposal here addresses the first part of the three part work. The project traces publishing initiatives, thus is a literature review of key research based architectural practices and their theoretical output between 1961 to 2021. 
* problem/ We are in a post-information age for environmental and spatial disciplines. Unlike even 10years back there is more data, information sets and knowledge product types than required. #alexandermethods tries address that problem in part by assembling an information infrastructure, living archive to inform a theoretical spatial design practice.
* significance/ Critical urban design and urban planning discourses have resulted in the production of non-critical architectural practices. Theoretical, critical design is no longer part of the repertoire of architectural practices today. The opportunity Alexander's body of work presents is to configure a model of theory making in practice.  
* information landscape/ Architectural archives tend are fixed sites of investigation and present tends make them available as subscriptions. Most of Alexander's writings are found online and requires a directed and updated archival mandate. Presently compiling accessible work is in progress at this repository https://github.com/spatialresearch/productivitypatterns   
* architectural research/ The work done by Alexander is relatively unknown to a generation both in academia and practice. The project is a necessary resource to assemble firstly to revisit ideas of an era and assist in anticipating its possible futures.

### 3.	Outline
* question/ Can #alexander revitalize interests in architectural theory as a practice mandate?
* aim/ map progress of Christopher Alexander's practice, the network it produced between and after the books published from '62 to '12
* objectives/ 
  * 01. to draft a methodology to conduct a literature search on work produced by a practice of a past from knowledge products distributed online.         
  * 02. to identify the key concepts advanced by alexander and its development in the years he's been active. 
  * 03. to model an accessible framework to aid construction of a practice archive which guides future work   

### 4.	Resources, Methods
* compile the #alexander reading list - 2months April May 2022. Objective 01/ Using https://www.patternlanguage.com/ca/vitae.htm as a reference point collecting books, papers, and lectures are in progress. Possibilities to gather different material content with various levels of access onto a single virtual platform are ongoing tests. All of #alexander books are sourced and his papers are in process of being compiled. Some behind paywalls require institutional support to access. 
* archive anxiety, literature search in the post information age - 2months June July. The necessity of the project came about owing to work done on mumbaiopendata.org and questions it posed on the status of architectural practice in India. Archive fever of a time is now upgraded to archive anxiety as a state to conceptualise social material culture of today. The paper presented addresses how times have changed and what are the new methods to identify these changes, thus necessitating a newer articulation. 
* mapping Alexander's spatial research strategies - 3months August October. Objective 02/ A result of content compiled till now five phases are observed around ideas produced by the practice. Four of these are shifts between four of his publications that begins with Community and Privacy and culminates at Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth.
* Alexander vs Schön's reflective practice - 2months November December. Though the propositions in Donald Schön's The Reflective Practitioner has transformed work of a generation, Alexander's ideas seems to have preceded or possibly laid ground for reflection in practice as an ideology. To what extent both positions find common ground is factor to address when considering future.
* addressing knowledge gaps, proposal for an alexander design studio plan - 1month January 2023. Objective 03/ Architectural design studio's rarely address theory making that goes into solving an architectural question. Studios focus more on drawing of plans instead of strategies to think them out. If a theory centric #alexander studio is planned, can it help trigger students to see their learning practice and therefore future professional work differently.
