* cleaning book ideas, implementing what3words titles.
* The question the research tries to address is what is idea management and how does it create a form of knowledge?
Now that sentences are consolidated as a #toolforthought the mandate now becomes to sort out all the four books to work and tie up before December.
Sentences are in part planning but also writing depending on which day it is.
To test out is titling of the notes. 
Rather than conventional titles, if the three word mapping of what.three.words eg https://what3words.com/toddler.geologist.animated is that better than just date and daily sentences as the present schema.
Everything now lies at best ways to find and link ideas together.
Conventional titling of objects in a virtual space like folders may be broken simply because at scale it doesn't work.
Full titles can get too long. 
This one is an experiment.
When this phase will change is also another point to address.
Rather than words what are the other possibilities the file names are retooled to perform better.
All of this process optimisation and documentation of that development.
This at the moment is only addressing notes only across all three apps.
Sentences - Foam VS Code, material archive - Evernote, drafts - OneNote.
It is easier to export from OneNote to any processing framework.
State for folders and how sustainable the system is, requires review.
At the end we have a design problem of having way too much content and what does one do with all of that material.
The architectural question of space of information on a hard drive and what becomes of it is the attribute explored. 
Getting back to books.
