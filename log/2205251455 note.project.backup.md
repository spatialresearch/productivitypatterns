* editing 2201141115 #roamnotes #writingpractice.
* Cleaning of notes is another sub-framework to create daily notes.
This lists some days that I looked at the tag #writingpractice in roam.
There is no analysis of the material but an extended day two thinking on reviewing notes in daily sentences for the year till now.
Problem statement to address is how is personal information reorganised into a structured knowledge product?
Instead of storing information sets in folders, the plot now is to map content on your hard drive into a framework.
Why?
You don't forget the material downloaded or in some way accessed.
Record everything, continually everyday.
There is a past of almost 23years of digital files which needs some kind of audit but to do that as sentences does it work?
Is it feasible?
How sustainable is it?  
To write down 300words a day, even on a busy day works, it may not get published on the same day but it is possible.
In cases such as this writing till a multiple of 300 comes about is the decided upon productivity pattern.
Just like you can lose folders, tags also can get lost, confused or misplaced.
There seems for all purposes no significant improvement between folders or tags especially when accounting for human error.
The daily notes page was a revelation, an epiphany when first encountered in #roamresearch. 
It made sense to log all information consumed in a software assisted environment. 
There it is easier to block reference, here it will for all purposes be a draft.
Since there is no structure on what daily sentences can achieve what becomes of it is the problem at hand.    
11 months of daily sentences are drawing to a close and it all but .md files.
Daily sentences should ideally extend into daily drawing.
As observed earlier in the making of other systems, year one is drawing it up, year two is testing it and year three is actually making it happen and hopefully scaling it.
The trick is disciple to get a working framework in place and then implement it.
This is addressed a bit earlier too, review personal information stacks before collecting newer content. 
With so much out there and the scope of the project really broad both #zettelkasten3 and #alexanderkoolhaas results seem distant.
In addition to text there is a #pinkelephantlibrary and an ever increasing image archive.
Sentences up till now have only addressed fleeting thoughts or it was meant as daily exercise to start writing for the day.
That has not happened.
June 2019, year 01.
June 2020, year 02.
June 2021, year 03.
Now June 2022 on the immediate horizon. 
Daily sentences seems like an index in itself.
Moving early notes out from onenote is also a todo to look into.
Soon.

- `wednesday` 18:27 #projectidea architecture copyright
    - thinking on open-source architecture
    - would anyone know about copyrights on architectural plans? what is the status of building plans that are say 70years old?  
    - my point is if theoretically if a database of plans and drawing that are outside copyright they can well be adapted or reused. in a way. again just as theoretical construct. i am channelling ARM here. 
    -  https://opensource.com/life/16/5/6-open-source-architecture-projects 6 open source architecture projects to check out
        - http://www.wikihouse.cc is an open-source construction system that uses CNC machine-cut wood panels to build homes and other structures. It was created by a UK-based architectural group and has since expanded internationally.
        - http://www.opendesk.cc is a group of UK-based designers that share their furniture designs under a Creative Commons license. Their catalog includes different types of office furniture, including desks, cupboards, and chairs. Etsy, Google, Greenpeace, and others have already installed Opendesk furniture in their offices.
        - http://www.aker.me is a branch of Open Source Ecology that aims to develop urban agriculture and make it easy for every one to cultivate their own food. The portfolio consists of designs for CNC-cut plywood gardening equipment, beehives, chicken coops, and more.
        - http://www.elementalchile.cl is an architecture studio created by renowned Chilean architect Alejandro Arevana. He recently published AutoCAD DWG files for four of Elemental's public housing projects under Creative Commons licenses.
        - http://www.paperhouses.co publishes open source home projects designed by talented architects worldwide. Its aim is to popularize high-quality home designs and fight against the low quality of construction in many suburban areas. The designs are not site-specific and can be modified easily thanks to a flexible construction system. 
    - there are several architecture offices closing or are shutting down and have several unbuilt projects or ideas that they have completed
    - rather than trying to rework designs all the time, there can be some way to attribute architectural drawings that it generated from a certain source
    - what the idea tries to do is to repurpose energies already invested in a project before and modify or update them for the time it may be appropriated

    - https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/designandscience/release/2 Can design advance science, and can science advance design? by Joichi Ito
        - Much of academia revolves around publishing research to prestigious, peer-reviewed journals. 
        - Peer review usually consists of the influential members of your field reviewing your work and deciding whether it is important and unique. 
        - This architecture often leads to a dynamic where researchers focus more on proving the value of their research to a small number of experts in their own field than on taking the high-risk of an unconventional approach. 
        - This dynamic reinforces the cliché of academics: learning more and more about less and less. 
        - It causes a hyper-specialization where people in different areas have a very difficult time collaborating–or even communicating–with people in different fields.
        - Peer-reviewed academic papers were a very important system to build scientific knowledge before the Internet, but in many ways, they may be holding us back now. 
        - Stewart Brand likens academic papers to tombstones reading: “we thought this subject to death and this is where we buried it.” 
        - I propose iteratively designing a new antidisciplinary journal with an open collaborative model of interaction in contrast to the structured and formal peer review system in order to tackle the most pressing and most interesting problems and ideas of our times and itself be an experiment.
    - https://alexvermeer.com/unpacking-suitcase-words Unpacking Suitcase Words
        - Suitcase words are still useful. In day to day life they simplify communication and prevent us from being distracted by unnecessary detail in what we’re saying. 
        - Picturing our brains as having a tidy division between the ‘conscious’ and the ‘unconscious’ reduces our incredibly complex brain to two suitcase words that—while useful—constrict genuine knowledge-seeking about how the brain really works. 
        - If we are aiming at a deeper understanding of what ‘consciousness’ or ‘morality’ or ‘right’ is, we must unpack them.

* Oct 02, 2014 - 19:39 UTC » MIT Media Lab - Science 
        - Media Lab co-founder Nicholas Negroponte famously coined a twist on the academic dictum that faculty must "publish or perish." 
        - Media Lab faculty, he said, must "demo or die." 
        - I have made a modification- "Deploy or die." 
        - I'd like all of the Lab's faculty and students thinking about how their work ultimately deploys in the world, and if they can deploy it themselves, even better.

- `friday` 10:10 #projectidea first architectural project
    - research into mapping the first architectural project of indian architectural practices in the country with an objective to understand what do practices consider as good architecture, the status of their practice, and what they see as their future 
    - the necessity to do the project is to try and identify how architecture practices are understood as and therefore what is architecture in 21st century india
    - https://www.architecturaldigest.in/story/a-century-old-bungalow-in-belgaum-transformed-into-an-architects-studio eg. this was started in an old house and it looks interesting. it looks nice what other forms are out there 
    - then there is this https://vimeo.com/512983588, it would have really looked good in pictures but this experiment of engaging as say whatever this non-linear narrative is becomes a kind difficult point of entrance to think about the house
    - it could be that most of the buildings accessed are some kind of early investigatory pursuits by practices that are just starting out and may not have long term mandates of engagement

                - advertisement for a school and its culture of making, possibilities and opportunities the network of the college presents and learnings possible within the environment created. its definately better than IIT which is only a brand and an association that you can wear on you for the rest of your life. education today, or where you are educated could define your understanding of what architecture is understood as

            - design ⭐⭐⭐ Bhopal
                - an alright portfolio of architectural thought, transcribed from admission to architectural journeying with professional practice in between. the friction bit of the writing can tend to meander while the architecture part is necessary to stand by for what it's worth. most architectural writings are reflections.   
                - between 2014 an example of a not so privileged education in the country where there is a rejection of the college and a pursuit in going towards a learning of ones own. something the masters had done in their time.  
  - india kindle architectural biographies is a micro collection assembled to trace practice trajectories of architects in the country. from the early masters to gen x architects, the genre has spanned four generations after independence. this lot is a map of the state of reflections on what architecture means from different perspectives both a result of work done and time spent.  
  - understanding or locating an indian architecture in this broad landscape of ours is not very
  - methodology of picking kindle biographies of architects and how they impact a thinking about the profession that is particularly non available in the mess of the curated architectural websites were only a certain kind of work is looked into and displayed for consumption. owing to the limited nature of this type of book produced and in the Indian landscape, architectural biographies tell of various aspiration of architectural narratives in the country. 
  - ways of knowledge production in architecture, places of practice a result of the networks available for work to be done in a certain way. its possible to do things or implement certain ideas only in specific places and situations.  
  - then the actual value of money of the book purchased as a reference, documents to keep going back to as guides 
  - what is an architectural book? what was its proposes in producing one? how has the biography changed the way one looks at locating or situation a practice of architecture? what do these stories have to help either understanding the practice of a place-based spatial strategy?   
  - architectural practices in different cities are understood very distinctly and therefore what it means to be an architect. architecture of the masters as seen in the distinct output of Suha and Karan. 
  - the practice in the scale the masters has done work isn't possible or unattainable for the current generation owing to shifting landscape of architects in the field and information technology making its strides
  - paper and the making of a good architectural book. even though all architects, have to have basic knowledge of paper avaliable in the market to print and at-least fundamental graphic design skills, somehow these are missing is most of all the books. its a disappointment mostly how the fuss spent in the making of the architectural portfolio doesn't somehow translate down to well designed documents. kindle documents to make may be partially excused owing to some advanced skill-sets required but a well designed book can make reading of the book a better experience that BV Doshi, Gautham Bhatia and Christopher Benninger has shown.  
  - what it can be as an object and what we can learn about telling of architectural stories about practice conducted or practice aspired. does stories have any intrinsic value in the setting up of the profession or they have to be seen in isolation. should one be considered better than the other or every strain have a space of discussion and how to improve it. 
  - the persona of the architect is more prevalent in the making of the architectural building than the architecture itself. what the architect and his ideas are significant for a generation to come after them and therefore changing architectural imagination and therefore methodology of recognition in it.   
  - there is lot of mediocre work done in every field, the purpose of this list is to define the field of architectural writing in India and try and identify the various avenues available and the possibilities of what writing is to the profession. say you have similar activities in the other field like in engineering or medicine, how to look at the architectural biography is like to look at it for inspiration. find images to generate inspirations and then built on from there.
