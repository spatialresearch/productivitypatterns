* How does data collections change architectural research and practice regarding the past, present, and future?
* The past two years has visibly increased material access of architectural information and knowledge online. With this content deluge, status of any project done in the past and proposals planned in the future are subject to revision. A new knowledge product is the living archive of a practice. If a brief history is outlined, it starts with blogs, then the website, social media comes after, and now video and sound files of work done are distributed by practices, discussing their projects. Though it is possible, not many practices publish their archives. The architectural archive yet is not directly seen or professionally accessed outside of a practice or dedicated institutional facility. Now with the prospect of accesses to an alternate framework of resources which is still in its nascent stages, some questions come about. Why should another practice look at a body of work not produced exclusively by them? What value can a distant past, potentially dated set of ideas have for another? Is it a more sustainable pursuit to have access to solutions tested out previously to extend on a generation/s after? To address the inquiry, the research as method assembles a digital archive of material available on the work of Christopher Alexander. On a preliminary survey most of his work is found distributed though different states of access. Alexander is one of the few architectural practices who has achieved a cross-disciplinary engagement around ideas heâ€™s proposed. The significance of engaging with his work thus extends a previously limited reach of architectural ideas. An extended set of questions the study raises are as follows; what resources are required to compile all his writings within a structured framework? What then is the everyday utilitarian purpose of such an assembled service? If an archive is a new tool to aid design practice, what form should it take, how should it scale over time? Can the model be a template to frame the architectural practice as a public archive built iteratively over time and collaboratively.

* Bio: Isaac is an architect based in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India, currently developing a research based architectural practice. His ongoing research is a literature survey of architectural imagination between 1961 to 2021. The work extends into an open access database on the subject. This research also is a foundation to develop towards a practice-based Ph.D. research. He has previously worked in traditional construction, urban design research publishing and academia.
