* rewriting the answers again.
* How has the emergent data society materialized in architecture?
Knowledge about and of architecture is extrapolated through projects and augmented representations of built environment, there is a shift in aesthetic in what architectural knowledge is, which a while back was only represented by orthographic views.
* What new typologies have been developed? 
Data is now the new tool to draw architecture with, the codes that describe desired spatial solutions, imagined or otherwise. 
* What role did architecture play in the emerging discussion about artificial intelligence? 
There is an objective factual answer and then there is a position of possibility, this is the state of the discussion. To note architects aren't computer scientists therefore we are only using tools that are given to us. If we have to participate in the AI discourse we have to make tools themselves only then can a valid conversation begin on how AI can integrate into architectural making.

* Where is the building in this vast, interactive and extractive information system of data production? 
We are seeing the building differently, since the way we are drawing what a building is has changed the role of the building in our discourses on architecture also has iteratively changed.

* How can we explore digital archives to think new imaginaries and develop new narratives about and by buildings? 
We need newer skills to recognize what an archive has to offer and then take that information base to build newer imaginations of what is possible with building, spatial practices narratives.

* In which visual and written languages are the new narratives and imaginaries created, and how are they organized?
Drawing about buildings and visualization of information making up those buildings are our newer narratives, should it be different or distinct than how they were in a past is a question to address.

* Are there other kinds of narrative systems, non-visual, non-linguistic? Material and sensory ones? And what would that mean?
Should we force newer narrative orders in the creation and the imagination of architectural knowledge, what is the status or the gaps in the current narrative orders that newer frameworks are requested?

* Who is developing the narratives, and for whom?
How is architectural knowledge reaching out to anyone outside of architecture, who needs knowledge about architectural theory or the making, solving of spatial solutions and to what purpose?

* If post-humanism might (re-)direct the new data-landscapes, what sort of data buildings might come out of this shift?
Work an architectural practice produces is a post-human data landscape which has a performative nature of its own as a living archive, creating newer possibilities with material generated in a past.

* How does data collections change architectural research and practice regarding the past, present, and future? 
The more information you have in a present it changes both the imagination of the past and the possibilities in the future.
