* ways of seeing the world and worlds.
* How we design is very dependent on the culture of making, and the methodology imparted to us either in school or in any kind of design education we have had access to. Design of anything is learned by tracing patterns of either the idea in question or parts of it and then extrapolating them into various situations. Any form of drawing either design, construction, or shop, is a parti, that we copied or designed on our own. How the patterns became forms rarely makes it into any discussion. Why do the designs we produce look the way they do? What is the methodology that forms the shapes we come up with? If at all there is a frame to think about design methodology, what does that assemblage look like? To make design operate within a set of self-imposed guidelines is possible. The publishing practices by #alexander and #koolhaas are testament to that and very idiosyncratic in positions. Green building code and parametric design are two of the most popular structured design methods. Broadly software controls and at times code dictates how we think about design making and production. Theories from the west are that we have access to since it is in English. Thought processes of the east, AI translation services are a portal to access. Conservation, urbanism, and urban planning have their extended influence. We imported modernism here and all of contemporary #indianarchitecture, critical regionalism is postmodernism. Furthering positions into a past is possible with colonial, classical, and ancient spatial strategies but it is a direction that a practice decides. Material, even landscape, at times does dictate terms as well. With this list of sorts, how then can we think # of architectural design as a modifiable methodology? How does it operate across regions and time? What is the state of thinking about design methods in #india? and has #indianarchitecture continued critical regionalism as a method? or do we consider it only as a phenomenon of a generation?
