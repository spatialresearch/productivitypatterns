* reading an archive of post-modern Indian architectural books.
* Independence gives opportunity and optimism to start afresh after 200years of colonization.
Modern architecture is imported to frame a new direction for nation building. 
With this trajectory, we have a consolidated set of guides on what was expected of us.
Quite often there is a confusion on the difference between architecture and building. 
For everyone else both looks the same, only architects seem to express an anxiety about selected few. 
Architecture is but buildings, those which participates in a conversation about spatial practices and culture of times they are built in, their status in the present.

* The conversation about how we have built in the past 75years is divided into the following phases, 1947 - 1984, 1984 - 2019, the years of Covid comes after.
A story of #indianarchitecture in three parts.
Phase one is modernism, 1947 to '84.
Phase two there after, till '19, the "critically regionalist" building, or post-modernism is when #indianarchitecture finds an original identity and truly becomes free.
The era produces masterworks for a global India.
A newer freer Indian architectural discourse begins with the preparations form a 1985 exhibition. 
It is a refined narrative of a community.
The presentation is about buildings and their relationship with a context.
An aspiration, to develop ideas that build on our vernacular heritage rather than blindly import of technology and ideas as an indicator of modernity.
Innovate an indigenous solution.

* Early 1980's is also beginning of an epoch when there is optimism about a new landscape for architectural practice, which collectively is agreed upon by the fraternity and an urgency exists to participate in making of built heritage futures. 
Unlike art, architecture is a public practice.
A public performance of living.
In '85 was the Architecture of India exhibition, '86 Vistara, '00 The South Asian survey as part of World Architecture 1900-2000 exposition, and '16 The State of Architecture, these set of discourses have collectively defined architecture production in the country.
The narrative is a tradition, imagined, developed, and carried forward. 
To define movements and for conservation architectural narratives are assembled.
From between 2016 and '19, I collected and build an archive of most published books on #indianarchitecture on this second phase of architectural writings. 
The lot is around 150 books, I am still in the processes of consolidating a bibliography.
The mandate is not so much about buildings but about ideas and authors who has in the time frame, have extended the grand discourse, started parallel discussions or framed newer perspectives. 

* The project proposed for this participation is to consolidate this list of architectural ideas between 1984 and 2019, outline how a new landscape of a time critically unfolded.
Who are the authors and the ideas? 
What is the legacy we have inherited?
What are the possibilities to take the conversations forward into the future?
https://www.instagram.com/shoppingtheatre.inc/ now hosts the project.
Outcome of the engagement is to present a completed bibliography and an accompanying essay on methods to answer the broader question, what did we do with our freedom to build?
