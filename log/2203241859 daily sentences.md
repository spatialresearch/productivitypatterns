* Maybe.
Work of Christopher Alexander misses all canons and theory compilations.
It is not deliberate but he doesn't fit the categories defined by a type of books.
He finds place in studies on computation and architectural design but that too is an uncomfortable association.
Alexander's original process formulation of patterns doesn't produce the urban icon's deconstruction facilitates. 
Ideas that exist outside of the canon as in this case can shift the paradigm of how we understand constructed knowledge landscapes.
From what I have till now Alexander's notes have their origins in Saurashtra, the west of Ahmedabad.
That is where he does his field work which becomes his PhD dissertation.
Around 1961 he was in the country.
His other Indian collaboration is with B.V. Doshi.
The paper is titled `Main Structure Concept: A Role for the Individual in City Planning`.
Published in the June of '64 it is an edited lecture given in '62.
To observe, Alexander is one of the earliest contemporary architects to publish scientific papers.
Even though it is credited to Doshi, the tone is very much Alexander.
It describes a conversation about overlapping concerns on #indian rural spatial organisation and urban, institutional design.
For now there is nothing more about the association mentioned anywhere else than this.
The discussion critiques the profession even then by stating there is no actual actual need for architects since their only contribution to society is spatial problem solving.
All of Alexander's work is an attempt to fine tune the assembly of spatial organising patterns and make them accessible to non-architects.
Patterns takes a western turn when it becomes a language but there is some definitive future that was planned in the past which got buried in the detritus of time.
There is no evidence of Alexander in India after that but using his ideas to rethink regional discourses is a welcome, found opportunity.
