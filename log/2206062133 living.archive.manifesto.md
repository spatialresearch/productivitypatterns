* How has the emergent data society materialised in architecture? What new typologies have been developed? What role did architecture play in the emerging discussion about artificial intelligence?
* It squarely depends on what kind of architectural practice you are and what are the resources available for work.
The patronage this practice receives therefore the data required for a kind of work.
With so much material out there it can get confusing too, what to do with whatever is out there.
If there are origins to where to start from thinking about form an architectural practice should take and directions its developed it is through works of masters of a past.
The idea of thinking about masters and their work is dated but without knowing about their contribution in the grander narrative of architectural production what does an architectural practice have to offer.
`A living archive from a past for a future`.
The project is an attempt is sourcing from various online open access material found of works of master architects.
What masters, rather than star architects presents are certain ideals of practice and investigations on spatial typologies which can assist in building on ideals proposed in a past.
There are two ends to architectural knowledge production.
Either to accelerate the construction process and provide faster services or to create new knowledge.
This here is to create new knowledge, contribute to existing frameworks of thinking on spatial practices.
Christopher Alexander started thinking with computers.
It is therefore imperative to begin thinking about architectural data, its culture of production and its futures by building an archive of his work to guide operations ahead.
