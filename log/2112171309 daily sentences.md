* I started with this phase so I stick with it. #dailysentences is a project that is now all over the place. Writing has created a problem for thinking. It has delayed it extensively. Fixing that is the goal of productivity patterns. This is definitely my most self plagiarised text, I must add. Just thinking enabled text to flow onto the screen without any friction. Ideas constructing writing, written work, pause that. Then there is also the platform where content is made on. Platform/s are equally responsible, I would position on what the text becomes. Word I had a template, I still have one, to produce these sentences. On VS Code it is now a bit more sustainable than in word but long pieces of text, anything more than 300words, I still have to get a grip on, its form. Where it will all go, is all very undecided. I wish I had started using GitHub sooner, or I had found annual conversations as a product sooner to collate work, direct thinking. Platforms today have started logging productivity. Therefore there is this software-induced drive to keep at or produce work because of all gamification tricks apps and platforms have. GitHub is now a site, a tool to think about work. Thinking of producing knowledge work as software code, open-source software code has its gratification. Getting to productivity within newer frameworks of thinking also has its learning curve. The first was what to do with repositories created. For now, itâ€™s books as code, so basic .md files. Word, VS Code, Github, are interfaces that facilitate thinking and production of a type of work. #productivitypatterns focuses on organizing content that feeds into these platforms. A bit lame the writing of all but, for now, I say this is thinking. Productivity lies somewhere here in all of this with continued drafts I hope to find it soon. Opening repositories, uploading files and making folders are where I am on the GitHub learning curve. Project list I have almost figured, so is my review of progress.
