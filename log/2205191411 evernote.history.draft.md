* running through Evernote, the entire archive.
* To use any of the modern note-taking tools to get the best out of it, you need extensions.
Code compilers of what I understand is only text and different types and versions of it.
Everything is in a text environment.
They have diagrams vs drawing is what we do.
Thinking about writing as a coder is very different than thinking as a writer producing physical books.
Code works differently, a state I have to get to figure out how it works.
The mechanics of it.
Taking notes is like creating building blocks, raw material to larger ideas.
There is an anticipation on its futures.
Again very code like.
Last year Evernote was messy but they have evolved into a new version that works.
Evernote notes began in 2012.
Those early notes I have let go and started resetting it after #roamresearch in the March of 2021.
The new workflow is but an year old.
Rather than Luhmann's slip-box which is an enormous list of linked notes, this follows the waste-book discipline but with an updated tagging system ideally formed as #zettelkasten3.
When working on a project, directing all energies into a single stance of problem solving is better than multiple projects at once.
I have managed to make multiple projects into one with addressing note-taking as a documenting of history.
It is also a continuing, developing of framework of knowledge production.
Here too the ordering of notes are first #bigcityarchive, #culturalprecincts, and we have to get to #writingpractice.
The practice of taking notes, organising them, and then making something out of it is very time consuming.
There are now two larger writing exercises to address, one is #archiveanxiety and then a personal history of note-taking.
Does one lead into the other?
Do they have to be different essays?
