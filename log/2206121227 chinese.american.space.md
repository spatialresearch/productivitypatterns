* status of information flows.
* It has reached a point now, where information flows are hitting you at various speeds.
Even though material is all over the place, hoarding it in because of #archiveanxiety is something to address.
When there is so much, there is a tendency to forgot how to package material and submissions.
What is a knowledge product also becomes tricky when it all comes together.
Previously one link would suffice knowing about an event, today there are multiple perspectives to source from to understand what is going on.
It also depends on the domain and information flows that are prevalent in it.
Ecosystems of knowledge consumption.
Tech works very differently than knowledge systems about land.
When land is about drawing, tech operates more as event updates, therefore its news.
Without multiple perspectives knowing what is happening on land doesn't materialise. 
Transactions about lands doesn't have one singular perspective.
The Chinese space program and their updates are important as a case-study on that position.
All maps that we have had access till now were mostly American, those preloaded on the applications we use and also on wikipedia.
Survey of India maps are a recent phenomenon.
The non-english perspective, world-view is made possible since AI translations have become better in recent times.
Curation of where material is coming from is also necessary to address.
Working with sources that are country specific an the nature of knowledge it disseminates is very much a factor.
Everything to research about a land based concept is almost a literature review from a specific context.
What do the different perspectives present the position they are discussing.
Using multiple apps is both a problem of sorts also an advantage.
The problem is streamlining a system to sync them all together, how is information drawn from the various feeds, where it is sorted and finally how its filed for further retrieval.

* Born in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, Tomoaki Uno opened his office in Nagoya in 1990 and has created many beautiful architectures with a refined aesthetic and an exceptional sensitivity to structure and materials. The studio works on a range of projects, from residential architecture to product design, working closely with a carefully selected group of artisans to create all the architecture by hand. https://youtu.be/UaMiuv1ooEY
* Social Algorithms Research Group is to investigate urban issues from social and algorithmic point of view in order to open up an interesting discussion, exchange ideas, knowledge and methodology between different design approaches. The Group explores a great opportunity for those who are interested in the topic of urban, city, architecture and design research who want to be involved in the discussion of experimental design thinking, innovative way of collaboration between design researches. https://www.social-algorithms.com/about
